## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

*    What is a binary tree
*    What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
*    What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
*    What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
*    What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
*    What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
